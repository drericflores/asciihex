# How to Use ASCII / Hex Table

This application helps you explore the standard ASCII character set and its decimal and hexadecimal representations.
It is designed for students, developers, and engineers working with character encodings.

## Features

- Click a table cell to view the character, decimal, and hex value in the output pane.
- Right-click a cell to copy the character, decimal, hex, or full info to clipboard.
- Use the search bar to locate characters by typing the character, decimal value, or hex code.
- Export the table to CSV format using File > Export CSV.
- Adjust the font size using View > Font Small/Medium/Large.
- Toggle dark mode using View > Toggle Dark Mode.
- Access the About dialog from Help > About for app info.

## Usage Tips

- For control characters (ASCII < 32), the display shows [code] in place of the character.
- Search is case-insensitive and highlights exact matches.
- Dark mode helps reduce eye strain in low light environments.
- The app icon is embedded in packaged executables.
